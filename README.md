= HTML references exercise =

In the messy/ folder, we have a collection of html files and images 
that makes a simple website.  All files are in the same folder, which
is undesirable as the number of files increase.

The exercise is to create a clean structure as follows. Noticed that 
there is now 2 index.html files, one in the root folder and the other
in the gallery/ folder.
